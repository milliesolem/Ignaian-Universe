## Alphabet

The Dwarven alphabet consists of 12 sounds/glyphs

Transcribed to latin alphabet, these are:
A E U
Z K/G N
M J B
V R F/Th

## Grammar
Dwarven is an agglutinative language. Basic sentence structure is: verb-subject-object-time

### Pronouns:

I/me (1st person signular) = A
We/us (1st person plural) = Ja
You (2nd person signular) = E
You (2nd person plural) = Je
3rd person signular = U
3rd person plural = Ju

As you can see, pluralizing a pronoun only requires adding a 'J' before the pronoun.

Fun fact: Dwarven has no verb for "to be" or "is", rather this is implied.
