## Grammar
Dwarven is an agglutinative language. Basic sentence structure is: verb-subject-object-time. Prefixes will often be single consonants. When you have several prefix or suffix consonants after eachother, they are pronounced with an /i/ in between. When writing this language in latin script, an "i" is sometimes put there to denote this.

### Pronouns:\

I/me (1st person signular) = A\
We/us (1st person plural) = Ja\
You (2nd person signular) = E\
You (2nd person plural) = Je\
3rd person signular = U\
3rd person plural = Ju

As you can see, pluralizing a pronoun only requires adding a 'J' before the pronoun.

Fun fact: Dwarven has no verb for "to be" or "is", rather this is implied.

### Possessives:

Posessives take the form of adjectives of the form of having the prefix F followed by the pronoun or noun denoting the owner.

"Where is my axe?" - "V-fa-kukmazu?" *(Literally "where my axe now?")*\
"where are my axes?" - V-fa-j'kukmazu?"\
"We are children of Kareth" = "Ja'Fikareth-j'Vunm" *(Literally "We of Kareth -- children")*

my - fa\
our - fja\
your (singular) - fe\
your (plural) - fje\
his/her/its/their (signular) - fu\
their (plural) - fju



### Time:\

Time modifiers are important in order to talk about the past, present and future. Talking of the persent requires\

Tenses/time words:\

Infinitum: *No word*\
Present tense: -ma\
Past tense: -me\
Future tense: -mu

### Questions:

In order to modify a sentence into a question, the sentenece must start with a question word, such as:\

Why = B\
Where = V\
How = K\
When = Z\
Whence = R

It must also end with the word "Zu" to denote it as a question. For example "where are you?" in dwarven is "V-e-ma-zu"\
